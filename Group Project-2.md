## Changes

- The n = 4 relationship `placed` was easily broken into 3 binary relationships, thus having it as an n=4 relationship was redundant and is now broken into `placed`,`ordered to` and `paid with` all of which have no attributes and with constraints as shown in the diagram
- The n=3 relationship `reviewed` is now converted to a n=4 relationship `reviewed` to contain the order details of the product the user is reviewing
